**Drilling Systems & Risk Engineering**  
Physics-informed real-time decision systems for well operations • Digital twin architecture • Complication prevention

I build production-grade drilling decision logic: translating drilling mechanics, hydraulics, and operational constraints into deterministic and model-assisted algorithms that run in real time.

## Core Systems I Design

| System Area | Engineering Logic | Typical Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Early Complication Detection | D-Exponent trends + DMA (Divergence of Moving Average) + DMSA (Divergence of Moving Slope Average) for early deviation detection and escalation rules. | Earlier warning of kick/loss risk and stuck-pipe precursors; reduced NPT exposure. |
| Drilling Efficiency & Dysfunction Control | Real-time MSE/DSE modeling, dysfunction classification, and parameter guidance tied to operating envelopes. | ROP improvement, bit/HA reliability, and more stable drilling. |
| Risk Engineering (KRI) | KRI architecture for automated event logging, thresholds, and response workflows (rig-side to office). | Lower human-factor variability; consistent risk handling across assets/teams. |
| Hydraulics-Aware Monitoring | ECD/SPPA deviation logic integrated into risk and cleaning/stability signals (not standalone “plotting”). | Better hole cleaning and stability control; faster recognition of adverse trends. |
