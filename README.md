## About Me

I am a Senior Drilling SME and Digital R&D Specialist with over 14 years of experience in the Oil & Gas industry. My career is defined by a unique hybrid expertise: combining deep physical rig operations knowledge with advanced informatics and software engineering.

I bridge the gap between traditional well engineering and modern digital ecosystems. By leveraging my background in both Petroleum Engineering and Informatics, I develop high-impact solutions for real-time drilling risk analytics, autonomous optimization, and physics-based machine learning models. My goal is to transform complex operational data into modular, scalable, and actionable software architectures that drive efficiency and safety in the field.
